### MICROSERVICES

ScaleCube Services provides a low latency Reactive Microservices library for peer-to-peer service registry and discovery 
based on gossip protocol ad without single point-of-failure or bottlenecks.

ScaleCube Services Features:

* Provision and interconnect microservices as a unified system (cluster)</li>
* Async RPC with java-8 CompleteableFutures support
* Reactive Streams support with RxJava.
* No single-point-of-failure or single-point-of-bottleneck
* Cluster aware and distributed
* Modular, flexible deployment models and topology
* Zero configuration, automatic peer-to-peer service discovery using gossip
* Simple non-blocking, asynchronous programming model
* Resilient due to failure detection, fault tolerance, and elasticity
* Routing and balancing strategies for both stateless and stateful services
* Low latency and high throughput
* Takes advantage of the JVM and scales over available cores
* Embeddable to existing Java applications
* Message Driven based on google-protocol-buffers
* Natural Circuit-Breaker due to tight integration with scalecube-cluster failure detector.
* Support Service instance tagging.
