The service fabric enables microservice Developers Rapidly develop Distributed, Resilient, Reactive, High-End Modern applications that scales. It greatly simplifies and streamlines asynchronous programming and provides a tool-set for managing microservices architecture. Service Fabric has been designed carefully with the experiences earned over the years from the implementation of many Online Services and platforms. As a result, Service Fabric I/O has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility without a compromise.
